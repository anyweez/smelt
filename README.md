Sor is a tool for checking your answers to a collection of curated practice problems. Pick a problem that you want to solve from [sorjs.com](https://sorjs.com), create a file with a function matching the specified name for the problem, and run:

```
sor your-file.js
```

Note that each file can only contain a solution to a single problem.

## Installation

Sor should be installed globally; run `npm install -g sor` and you should be set.

## Submitting new problems

The practice problem archive is built by its community. See our [submission guidelines](https://github.com/anyweez/sorjs.com#submitting-challenges).
